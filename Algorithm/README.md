# Algorithm

> Here is just a garage for the code which I used to practice the algorithm.

### Languages:
This part is not limited about the languages I will use, which means I could use `C++`, `Python`, `Java`, `JavaScript (with or without HTML)` and `C#` as I wish. 
Of course, other languages, such as `Kotlin`,`Dart`, `Go`,`Rust` ect, also have their possibility to be used. I promise.

### Coverage:
It won't cover all the algorithm I learn, It's jsut a place for me to store some code of these algorithms :)
